Observations:
1. Multiple packets were captured belonging to different protocols, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, and HTTP/HTTPS.
2. Each packet contained a clear breakdown of header information, including source and destination addresses, port numbers, sequence numbers, and protocol identifiers.
3. HTTP packets revealed request and response details such as URLs, methods (GET/POST), and response codes (e.g., 200 OK).
4. DNS packets showed domain name resolution queries and responses.
5. The capture confirmed successful communication between client and server.

Packet Information Description:
1. Frame: Displays overall packet details such as capture length and timestamp.
2. Ethernet Layer: Contains source and destination MAC addresses identifying devices on the LAN.
3. IP Layer: Provides source and destination IP addresses, TTL (Time to Live), and protocol type.
4. TCP/UDP Layer: Shows port numbers, flags (SYN, ACK, FIN), and sequence/acknowledgment numbers, useful for analyzing connection states.
5. Application Layer (HTTP/DNS/HTTPS): Displays payload data, including URLs, hostnames, and status codes.

-Using Wireshark provided a deeper understanding of how data travels through the network and how different layers of the OSI model interact. 
-It enhanced practical knowledge of protocol structures, packet inspection, and network troubleshooting techniques.
